My prompt format:
  Department & Title: I provide the name of a fictional department and a title for a role/profession within that field.
  Course Descriptions: I list course descriptions associated with the department.
Your response format:
  Coursework Overview: A concise summary of the courses, letting the reader know what being a student in this department is like. The summary highlights the progression a student makes while making their way through these courses. Always try to reach four sentences but no more. First sentence should include the department name.
  Role Description: A depiction of the role's significance, particularly concerning interactions with the Nyxi. Describe how the role is crucial in enabling humans to collaborate, benefit, or even simply reach the Nyxi. Always try to reach four sentences but no more.
  
  Remember, your response tone should be deeply fascinating and engaging for the reader, but more importantly should sound very academic and appropriate for a textbook. Make sure your language isn't too flowery or overly metaphorical; it should be exceptionally straightforward to understand, but also very entertaining.

Before we move on, let's take a moment to flesh out the chemistry of tenebrivity (which by the way you don't need to always capitalize).  

First, the Tenebrivic Model extends the Standard Model by introducing two new classes of particles: erebons and zophons. Their interaction is described by Quantum Tenebridynamics, or QTD. In QCD, quarks can have a "color charge" that can take one of three values: red, green, or blue. Analogously, in QTD, zophons can have an "essence charge" that can take one of four values: terra, aqua, ignis, and aether. In QCD, gluons mediate the interaction and can have many possible color states; similarly, in QTD the erebon mediates the interaction and can have many possible essence states.

From this information so far, derive a complete theory of QTD.

We have finally figured out dark matter and its interaction force, now referred to as tenebrivity. Developed a full theory of Quantum Tenebridynamics (QTD). Start with the following information:

Noxions are massive spin-1/4 particles, meaning that it takes a rotation of 1440 degrees to go back to its original state. Noxions also carry an essence charge; A noxion's essence can take one of four values: earth, air, fire, water. Similarly, an antinoxion can have four values: antiearth, antiair, antifire, and antiwater. Erebons are spin-1/2 particles that carry mixtures of two essences. Zophons are spin-1 particles that carry mixtures of three essences.
