If you're reading this, then thanks so much for taking the time to enjoy my
inner universe! This "explorative textbook" is a tool to compile all the
details of the worldbuilding I've been doing on the side. The main concept was
to think through creating a language that was truly alien, not based on human
physiology whatsoever, and then expanding the history and culture of these
alien beings to build their world and also help inspire the lexicon of their
language.

The rest of this book is written from the perspective of humanity in this
world, circa the year 4242. While I do have a goal of some level of scientific
realism in this world, I also stay open to bend into fiction if it offers a
particularly interesting development. After all, if this in the far future, I
anticipate we've had many advances in our scientific knowledge.

In some cases I might offer some explanatory footnotes, but otherwise this is
the last you'll be hearing from "me". As I see you off into the world of the
Nyxi, I hope you enjoy your adventure! \\[48pt]
