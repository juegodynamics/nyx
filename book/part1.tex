\chapter{First Encounter}

\section{Approached by the Nyxi}

Following numerous close brushes with extinction beginning in the 23rd century,
humanity enjoyed a renaissance of sorts, achieving widespread peace and
cutting-edge technological developments. Colonizing the vast majority of our
galactic sector without encountering any Nyxian life, humanity seemed to have
reached the pinnacle of its explorative endeavors, especially after determining
the impracticality of intergalactic travel. The 41st century is often referred
to as the "Nulnaissance,"\footnote{\textbf{nul-} + \textbf{renaissance}} an era
marked by a notable absence of scientific advancements. A sense of profound
contentment pervaded society, prompting many to question the relevance of
further scientific pursuits. In essence, what more was there left to unearth?

Amidst this climate of widespread disinterest, in 4093 the esteemed Jimothy
Webbington Institute undertook the commission of an ambitious telescope
project. Though this instrument did not boast any groundbreaking technological
enhancements, it held the interest of a unique crew. Comprising seasoned space
experts, the team was also graced by the presence of an up-and-coming
apprentice scientist, Neb Elysium, who would later earn an esteemed place in
historical annals. The spacecraft was equipped with a wormhole filament to
facilitate instantaneous communication, piquing Neb's interest in conducting
temporal comparison experiments. While the scientific community considered this
domain to be well-trodden ground, Neb's innovative approach set the stage for a
serendipitous discovery.

In a departure from conventional methodology, Neb opted for ytterbium-based
atomic clocks over the traditional caesium-based variants, drawn by their
superior precision. Little did he anticipate the ramifications of this choice.
By positioning ytterbium clocks at opposite ends of the wormhole filament and
initiating a continuous pulse transmission, a potent signature of ytterbium was
broadcasted. Once this signal reached approximately 1.4 light-seconds beyond
Earth's surface, it catalyzed one of the most transformative events in human
history.

During a routine monitoring of pulses across the wormhole filament, Neb
observed an abrupt cessation of pulse reception from the Earth-end of the
filament. Rapidly escalating the situation, the research crew congregated to
investigate the anomaly. As assessments progressed, the wormhole underwent
unexpected expansions, and the researchers deduced that its Earth-anchored end
had been dislocated, though its new location remained undetermined.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter1_scientists.png}
	\caption{The crew of the JM-4093 Station looking on as the onboard wormhole unprecedentedly expands and stabilizes}
\end{figure}

A luminescent event then ensued, causing the surrounding area to radiate with
an intensity rendering direct observation impossible. Fortunately, Neb's
telemetry apparatus remained functional, meticulously recording an event of
unprecedented historical significance: the initiation of contact with an Nyxian
entity. later named the Nyxi.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter1_encounter.png}
	\caption{Humanity's inaugural encounter with the Nyxi. It is crucial to recognize that
		the perceived enormity of the Nyxi is attributable to spacetime distortions,
		stemming from their generation of a wormhole bubble. This advanced mechanism
		facilitated a simultaneous maintenance of their habitable environment while
		enabling communication.}
\end{figure}

Initial communications proved challenging. The Nyxi representative,
subsequently dubbed Protappellus,\footnote{\textbf{proto-} \textit{first} +
	\textbf{appellare} \textit{to call or summon}} attempted communication: "Wow! A
life form! We discerned your signature of Ytterbium, a vital resource for us.
Our intentions are peaceful. Are you amenable to trade?" However, its
articulations, constituted of an array of unfamiliar roars, buzzes, and chirps,
terrified Neb, prompting his exclamation, "Identify yourself! Please don't harm
me!" Protappellus naturally failed to understand and after observing a human,
quote "visibly flapping its internal meat to produce sound", was revolted at
the sight. In the ensuing confusion, the duo managed to exchange artificial
intelligence entities. These AIs were designed to analyze and understand
linguistic and knowledge structures, and fortunately they were capable of
bridging the communication gap.

\section{Nyxi and Humanity's Exchange}
In the wake of first contact with the Nyxi, a mutually beneficial partnership
was rapidly formed, wherein a profound exchange of knowledge ensued over the
following months, leaving an indelible mark on both civilizations. This
transformative period represented a crucible in which both species enhanced
their technological and scientific prowess by gleaning invaluable insights from
one another.

Humanity, standing at the cusp of a revolutionary shift in its understanding of
the cosmos, was introduced to the Nyxi's intricate grasp of a hitherto unknown
force they had already harnessed: tenebrivity\footnote{from \textbf{tenebrae}
	\textit{darkness}}. This newly christened term represented a fifth fundamental
force intrinsically tied to dark matter. Elusive and previously uncharted in
human research, tenebrivity was foundational to the Nyxi's mastery over
interstellar navigation. It was the force that granted them the remarkable
abilities for faster-than-light travel, making cosmic colonization not just a
dream, but a lived reality for them. The intricacies of this force held
boundless potential, promising humanity the keys to unlock the vast, uncharted
expanses of the universe.

Conversely, as the Nyxi delved into human knowledge, they were left awestruck
by the rapid advances humanity had made in the realm of biotechnology.
Particularly impressive to them were the sophisticated neural-computer
interfaces, which held promise to alleviate the Nyxi's challenges with network
disconnectivity — a long-standing issue that had hampered their collective
cognitive functions. Furthermore, humanity's holistic and advanced healthcare
systems, characterized by precision medicine and advanced genetic therapies,
presented potential solutions to the endemic diseases that had long plagued
Nyxi society due to their widespread colonization.

Armed with this newfound knowledge, a new epoch of collaborative efforts
emerged. Human scholars, working closely with their Nyxi counterparts, embarked
on an ambitious project to codify their insights into Quintenebrivity. The
result was the 'Periodica Tenebris', a comprehensive compendium detailing the
properties, manifestations, and potential applications of this mysterious force
(see \ref{PeriodicaTenebris}). Parallelly, the nascent discipline of Tenebrivic
Sciences emerged, promising to lead humanity to the furthest frontiers of space
exploration and cosmological understanding.

The Nyxi, for their part, wasted no time in assimilating humanity's
biotechnological marvels. Universal healthcare systems, modeled on Earth's best
practices that took thousands of years to develop, were instituted on
Nyxophora, their home planet. By incorporating human medical techniques and
technologies, they witnessed a significant decline in disease prevalence,
improving their societal health and longevity.

In culmination, the exchange went beyond mere transactional knowledge-sharing.
It represented a deep intertwining of two civilizations, each complementing the
other's strengths and mitigating their weaknesses. The resulting symbiotic
relationship paved the way for a golden era of cooperative technological and
interstellar expansion, establishing the groundwork for the intertwined
destinies of humans and the Nyxi in the vast cosmic theatre.
